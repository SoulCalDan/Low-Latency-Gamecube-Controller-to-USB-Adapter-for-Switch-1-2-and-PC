This is an open source FPGA based USB adapter to connect a Nintendo Gamecube controller to Switch 1|2 and PC. The adapter in Switch mode mimics the official Nintendo Gamecube adapter, but with significantly less latency. This adapter is made with Gamecube NSO (Nintendo Switch Online) in mind, and fixes the joystick calibration issue present in Nintendo's Gamecube emulator, allowing for improved joystick control in games like F-Zero GX and camera controls in Wind Waker.
