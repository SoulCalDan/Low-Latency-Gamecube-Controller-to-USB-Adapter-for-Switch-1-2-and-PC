	- JLCPCB may request part selection. Any 0402 resistor package will work for the 1k0 and 1k5. Be sure the 1k5 resistor is on the bottom right of the PCB (USB pullup resistor)
	- The USB-C connector must be the one from Molex. If JLCPCB does not display it, you can search for the part number directly.
